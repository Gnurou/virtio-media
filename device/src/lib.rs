//! This crate contains host-side helpers to write virtio-media devices and full devices
//! implementations.
//!
//! Both helpers and devices are VMM-independent and rely on a handful of traits being implemented
//! to operate on a given VMM. This means that implementing a specific device, and adding support
//! for all virtio-media devices on a given VMM, are two completely orthogonal tasks. Adding
//! support for a VMM makes all the devices relying on this crate available. Conversely, writing a
//! new device using this crate makes it available to all supported VMMs.
//!
//! # Traits to implement by the VMM
//!
//! * Descriptor chains must implement `Read` and `Write` on their device-readable and
//! device-writable parts, respectively. This allows devices to read commands and writes responses.
//! * The event queue must implement the `VirtioMediaEventQueue` trait to allow devices to send
//! events to the guest.
//! * The guest memory must be made accessible through an implementation of
//! `VirtioMediaGuestMemoryMapper`.
//! * Optionally, .... can be implemented if the host supports mapping MMAP buffers into the guest
//! address space.
//!
//! These traits allow any device that implements `VirtioMediaDevice` to run on any VMM that
//! implements them.
//!
//! # Anatomy of a device
//!
//! Devices implement `VirtioMediaDevice` to provide ways to create and close sessions, and to make
//! MMAP buffers visible to the guest (if supported). They also typically implement
//! `VirtioMediaIoctlHandler` and make use of `virtio_media_dispatch_ioctl` to handle ioctls
//! simply.
//!
//! The VMM then uses `VirtioMediaDeviceRunner` in order to ask it to process a command whenever
//! one arrives on the command queue.
//!
//! By following this pattern, devices never need to care about deserializing and validating the
//! virtio-media protocol. Instead, their relevant methods are invoked when needed, on validated
//! input, while protocol errors are handled upstream in a way that is consistent for all devices.
//!
//! The devices currently in this crate are:
//!
//! * A device that proxies any host V4L2 device into the guest, in the `crate::v4l2_device_proxy`
//! module.
